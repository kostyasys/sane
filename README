Collection of utilities to make ruby more user friendly.

Currently:

require_rel glob
  * require a file relative to the current, i.e.
   require_rel 'lib/filename'

Object#in?
 3.in? [1,2,3]
 => true
  
println
 like print, but with a carriage return at the end:
 println 1,2,3
 (prints 123\n)

enumerable-extra
  #new enumerable #map
  [1,2,3].map(:to_s) # applies it automatically! far less ugly than [1,2,3].map &:to_s

Don't leave home without these!
